<ul>
<u>Lightning and Electric Fields</u>


<li>
<p>Lightning is a discharge of electricity caused by the buildup of opposite charges between clouds and the ground or within clouds. It seeks the path of least resistance to neutralize the charge difference, which is typically the shortest and most conductive route.</p>
 </li>
 
<u>Why Metal Doesn't Attract Lightning</u>

 <p>
       <li>
<strong>Attraction:</strong> For lightning to strike, the electric field in the atmosphere and the conductive path to the ground matter more than the presence of metal itself. Sharp or pointed objects, regardless of material, can intensify electric fields, increasing the likelihood of a strike.
 
 </li>
 
 <br> 
  <li>
     <strong>Conduction:</strong> Metal facilitates the flow of electric current because of its highly mobile electrons, making it a great conductor.
    </li>
     <br>
 </p>  
 
<u>What Actually Attracts Lightning?</u>

 
 <li>
     <p>
       <strong>Tall Structures:</strong> Height plays a significant role in attracting lightning since taller objects are closer to the storm clouds, reducing the gap the lightning needs to travel.
       <br>
       <br>
       </li>
       
       <li>
<strong>Sharp Edges:</strong> As previously explained, sharp or pointed features enhance the local electric field, making them more likely targets.
</li>

<br>
<br>

<li>
<strong>Conductive Pathways:</strong> While metal doesn't attract lightning, it provides an efficient path for lightning to reach the ground if struck.

 <p>Every metal is a good conductor because of the metallic bonding in every metal element. In metallic bonding, the outer electrons are free to move, producing an electrostatic force between the positively charged metal ions and the negatively charged delocalized electrons. (1)</p>
 </div>
 
 </div>
  <div class="cuadrado2">
      <div class="azul">
 <p>Metal itself doesn't "draw in" lightning, but it's an excellent conductor. That's why being in contact with metal objects—like plumbing, electrical wiring, or even metal fences—during a thunderstorm increases the risk of getting shocked. It's also why cars with metal roofs provide safety; the lightning follows the metal frame and directs the electricity around passengers instead of through them.(4)</p>
  </div>
 </div>
 
  <div class="cuadrado3">
      <div class="azul">
 <p>The electric field is stronger on sharp or curved surfaces and weaker on flat or smooth areas. This happens because a larger curve makes the field weaker, while a smaller curve makes it stronger.</p>
  </div>
 </div>
  <div class="cuadrado4">
      <div class="azul">
 <p>Extremely tall structures like towers and skyscrapers are indeed more susceptible to strikes because they significantly reduce the insulating air gap between the cloud and the ground. (2)</p>
  </div>
 </div>
   <div class="cuadrado5">
      <div class="azul">
 <p>A lightning rod is a metallic rod, usually made of copper, designed to protect structures from lightning strikes by intercepting the electrical discharge and directing it safely into the ground. Since lightning tends to strike the highest object in an area, rods are placed at the highest points of buildings, towers, or ships. They are connected to the ground through low-impedance cables, allowing the electric current to dissipate safely. In buildings, the ground itself serves as the discharge point, while on ships, the surrounding water is used. This system prevents structural damage and reduces the risk of fire caused by lightning strikes. (3)</p>

    Lightning tends to strike tall and prominent structures more frequently because they provide the shortest path to the ground. Below are some examples of iconic monuments and how often they are struck by lightning:
</p>

<br>
<ul>
    <li>
<p><strong>Eiffel Tower (Paris, France):</strong> Receives approximately 37 lightning strikes over a 10-year period.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Berlin TV Tower (Berlin, Germany):</strong> Hits around 68 times in a decade.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Empire State Building (New York, USA):</strong> Suffers about 230 strikes in the same period.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Pic du Midi de Bigorre (France):</strong> This observatory in the Pyrenees records approximately 1,874 lightning strikes in 10 years.</p>
</li>
</ul>
