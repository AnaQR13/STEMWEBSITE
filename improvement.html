<p>We started with the common myth that metal objects attract lightning.</p>

<p>However, through our experiment, we aimed to prove that metal does not attract lightning but rather serves as a good conductor of electricity. Initially, we believed that metal might pull lightning toward it, but we discovered the oppositeâ€”metal does not attract lightning; instead, it provides a pathway for electricity to flow.</p>

<p>To test this, we conducted three trials lasting one, two, and three minutes, where we charged a rubber balloon by rubbing it against a surface to generate static electricity.</p>

<p>We then brought it near four different materials: wood (organic material), graphite (semi-metal), copper (metal), and silver (metal). By experimenting in a dark environment, we were able to observe whether small sparks of electricity were visible, indicating conduction. Our results confirmed that metals like copper and silver were the best conductors, producing small sparks, while wood, being an insulator, showed no signs of conduction.</p>

<p>From our observations, we concluded that metal does not inherently attract lightning but serves as a pathway for electrical discharge. This aligns with real-world physics, where lightning seeks the path of least resistance, often striking tall, sharp, or conductive objects rather than being drawn to metal itself.</p> 

Additionally, we learned that factors such as electric field behavior, object height, and sharp edges play a crucial role in determining where lightning will strike.</p> 

Understanding the distinction between attraction and conduction is essential for safety during thunderstorms and helps clarify the function of lightning rods, which redirect lightning safely to the ground.

<p>To further improve this experiment, we could:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><strong><u>Test more materials</u></strong>, including different metals and insulators, to compare conductivity.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong><u>Study real-world lightning strikes</u></strong> to analyze patterns in where and why they occur.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong><u>Explore modern lightning protection systems</u></strong>, such as advanced grounding techniques and materials.</p></li>
