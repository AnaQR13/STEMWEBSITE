<p>Hello Good Morning, today we will be presenting our myth, Do metals really attract lightning? We will be answering that question with this.
<br>
<br>
Many people think that metal attracts lightning, but that is wrong. Metal only conducts electricity. People believe this because the idea of conduction and attraction may sound similar, but that is untrue. It has important differences.
<br>
<br>
It is said that because metal is a good conductor as it has a metallic bonding. In metallic bonding, the outer electrons are free to move, producing an electrostatic force between the positively charged metal ions and the negatively charged delocalized electrons. As we said metal doesn't attract lightning but it provides a path for the lightning to follow. Most indoor lightning casualties and some outdoor casualties are due to conduction. Whether inside or outside, anyone in contact with anything connected to metal wires, plumbing, or metal surfaces that extend outside is at risk. Extremely tall structures, such as towers and skyscrapers, are indeed more susceptible to strikes because they significantly reduce the insulating air gap between clouds and the ground. That's why a lightning rod is of metal rod, usually made of copper, also since lightning hits the tallest object nearby, lightning rods are placed on top of buildings or ships, with the charge going into the soil or water.
<br>
FUN FACT: 
Wet metal is more likely to conduct electricity due to the water, not because of the metal itself. Other one is that lightning doesn't always strike the tallest object but often chooses the most conductive or sharpest path.
<br>
<br>
To understand more about this first, we need to know what is lightning. Lightning is a discharge of electricity caused by the buildup of opposite charges between clouds and the ground or within clouds. It seeks the path of least resistance to neutralize the charge difference, which is typically the shortest and most conductive route. For lightning to strike, the electric field in the atmosphere and the conductive path to the ground matter more than the presence of metal itself. 
<br>
<br>
To test this, we conducted three trials lasting one, two, and three minutes, where we charged a rubber balloon by rubbing it against a surface to generate static electricity. We then brought it near four different materials: wood (organic material), graphite (semi-metal), copper (metal), and silver (metal). Experimenting with a dark environment we were able to observe whether small sparks of electricity were visible, indicating conduction. Our results confirmed that metals like copper and silver were the best conductors, producing small sparks and only perceptible by sound, while wood, being an insulator, showed no signs of conduction.
<br>
<br>
We did this since static electricity builds up when the balloon is rubbed against the fabric. The excess electrons create a potential difference.
When you bring a conductor (a metal object) close to the charged balloon, the electrons leap through the air, creating a miniature lightning bolt.

As we already mentioned lightning tends to strike tall and prominent structures more frequently because they provide the shortest path to the ground. Below are some examples of iconic monuments and how often they are struck by lightning:
<br>
Eiffel Tower (Paris, France): Receives approximately 37 lightning strikes over a 10-year period.
Berlin TV Tower (Berlin, Germany): Hits around 68 times in a decade.
Empire State Building (New York, USA): Suffers about 230 strikes in the same period.
Pic du Midi de Bigorre (France): This observatory in the Pyrenees records approximately 1,874 lightning strikes in 10 years.

From our observations, we concl uded that metal does not inherently attract lightning but serves as a pathway for electrical discharge. This aligns with real-world physics, where lightning seeks the path of least resistance, often striking tall, sharp, or conductive objects rather than being drawn to the metal itself. Additionally, we learned that factors such as electric field behavior, object height, and sharp edges play a crucial role in determining where lightning will strike. Understanding the distinction between attraction and conduction is essential for safety during thunderstorms and helps clarify the function of lightning rods, which redirect lightning safely to the ground.
